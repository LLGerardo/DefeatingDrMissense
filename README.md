# DefeatingDrMissense
This was the final project for my intro to object oriented programming class. It utilizes several object classes for answer sets and questions sets and a driver class. It is an interactive java game that helps players learn about amino acids. Four levels test the user on four different properties of each amino acid: three-letter abbreviation, one-letter abbreviation, side chain polarity, and molecular structure. Images were implemented in the fourth level using Jframe; this is why there are many pngs in addition to the .java files.
